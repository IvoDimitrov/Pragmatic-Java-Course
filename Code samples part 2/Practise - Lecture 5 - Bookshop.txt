Develop 3 classes:

Book

 - String author

 - String name

 - String isdn;

 - double price;

 - int yearPublished;



Implement a method calculatePrice, which returns price + VAT for all books 

published after 1990 and, (price + VAT) - 10% for all books before 1990.



Person

 - String name

 - double money



 - boolean purchaseBook(Book book) - method which gets the book price and validates 

 if the person has enough money. If so, prints a message that the book.name was purchased 

 by person.name and reduces the amount of money.

 Otherwise, prints a message that informs that the person does not have sufficient funds. 

 Returns true or false depending on the operation result



Implement constructor for both classes above.



Bookshop:

 - double money;

 - in main method, create a few books (using Scanner), create a couple of Person 

 instances, and a Bookshop instance.

 - create a sellBook(Book book, Person person) method which tries to sell a 

 book to a person. If succeeded, increase money in Bookshop;
